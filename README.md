# E30 - Lincolnshire Poacher number station simulator

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire_Poacher_(numbers_station)

Inspired by https://twitch.tv/christheitguy 's shoutout sound, I wanted to replicate the number station, right down to actually sending coded messages.

This works on MacOS using `afplay` to play the audio files, but can most likely be adopted to work on other OSs.
